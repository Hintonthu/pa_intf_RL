"Joint Power Allocation in Interference-Limited Networks via Distributed Coordinated Learning"

Abstractâ€”The deployment of ultra-dense networks is one of the main methods to meet the 5G data rate requirements. However,
high density of independent small base stations (SBSs) will increase the interference within the network. To circumvent this interference, there is a need to develop self-organizing methods to manage the resources of the network. In this paper, we present a distributed power allocation algorithm based on multi-agent Q-learning in an interference-limited network. The proposed method leverages coordination through simple message passing between SBSs to achieve an optimal joint power allocation. Simulation results show the optimality of the proposed method  for a two-user case.
